\nThe Earmor ™ Hearing Protection Earmuff protects against dangerous noise at the same time allowing you to hear ambient sounds. Sounds are detected by two directional microphones and reproduced by the speakers inside the muffs.

\nThe M31 provides audible protection in noisy areas with impulsive noise, such as firearms use zones. The microphones mounted in the earmuffs improve the situational awareness of the user, while allowing him to hear sounds from close surroundings and to protect his hearing. Harmful sounds are limited to a safe level of 82 dB, and the lower are amplified.
\n
\nKey benefits of active hearing protectors:
\n1. Allow you to normally hear and even enhance standard sounds: speech, commands, instructions, sounds from the environment
\n2. Protect your hearing during shooting
\n3. Strengthen standard sounds - with volume control they let you hear better than without earmuffs.

\nWhen you're ready to step up your long-distance game, the Strike Eagle gives you more of the tools you need for less than you'd expect. Start with excellent edge-to-edge sharpness, and add a first focal plane (FFP) illuminated reticle for fast reads at any magnification and lighting situation. Add in our RevStop Zero System for a hard return to zero, and locking turrets for fast, stay-put adjustments. Build it around a 34mm tube that accommodates massive amounts of elevation and windage travel, and a throw lever for rapid magnification changes, and you've got a long-distance impact machine that'll have you wondering how you ever shot without it.

Along with expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 Window incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability to exceed rigorous military performance specifications.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5BB83DE"">While the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® </span><span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5BB83ED"">416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCARN MK 16/16S, and others.</span>

\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5BB840A"">In addition, a redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. Low profile ribs and new aggressive front and rear texture gives positive control of the GEN M3 in all environments, and a paint pen dot matrix has been added to the bottom panel of the body to allow easy marking by the end user for identification.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5BB8419"">The new, easy to disassemble flared floorplate aids extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection, but is slightly slimmer than before for better compatibility with tight double and triple magazine pouches. An included pop-off Impact/Dust Cover can optionally be used to minimize debris ntrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5BB8427"">Durable dual-side transparent windows allow for quick determination of approximate number of rounds remaining in the magazine.

\n<strong>This backup plan is always in sight.</strong>
\n
\n<strong>Runs on instinct. Runs at the speed of sight.</strong>
\n
\nThe Mepro FT Bullseye™ sight is the fastest, brightest, and most intuitive tritium fiber optic sights we’ve ever built. This low-profile single-night-sight design is powered by fiber optics to master the day, while premium-grade tritium handles even the darkest
\nblackout conditions.
\n
\nAligning with a single central point of focus, the Mepro FT Bullseye™ has the feel of a red dot sight. These Meprolight® night sights are drop- and shockproof, built for endless rounds under heavy recoil, and make an excellent upgrade sight to pistols we service like Smith &amp; Wesson, Springfield, IWI, Glock, and others. Its ultralight, snag-free design is easy to draw and gives you instinctive aiming under pressure.

\n<div><strong>About the Holster</strong></div>
\n<div>APN is an IWB and OWB holster designed for appendix carry or standard I/OWB carry on your waist. The holster is offered with an adjustment screw for accurate retention pressure and personal preference; a belt clip/J hook that allows five cant positions with a simple turn clockwise/counterclockwise; a sweat guard to buffer between the firearm and your body, to assist with better purchase of the firearm and to offer a degree of ventilation, without allowing sweat to pass to the slide of your firearm (the sweat guard is detachable and you may use the holster without it); a concealment wing (available for right-handed only) to push the grip of your firearm towards your body for less 'printing' (also removable); a rigid paddle that enables to carry the holster as OWB; <strong>and finally, the holster is ambidextrous and may be switched to left-hand use without any tools required.</strong>  The APN holster is highly concealable, very lightweight, completely washable, ventilated, highly durable, it is contoured for maximum comfort, and is extremely convenient for every day concealed carry.</div>
\n<div></div>
\n<div><strong>How to use </strong></div>
\n<div>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside your pants, in a location of your preference. The holster may be used for appendix carry or for standard IWB carry on your waist. Make sure the belt clip is outside your pants and over your belt, while its lower hook is catching the belt from underneath.
\n
\nIf using a J hook (belt clip), make sure it goes first over your pants (between your pants and the backside of your belt) and then catches the belt from underneath. If using a paddle, make sure to dismantle the belt clip, sweat-guard, and concealment wing first. Then click the paddle into the sweat-guard location. Place the holster on your hip and make sure the paddle is pushed all the way down on your belt.

\n<div><strong>About the Holster</strong></div>
\n<div>APN is an IWB and OWB holster designed for appendix carry or standard I/OWB carry on your waist. The holster is offered with an adjustment screw for accurate retention pressure and personal preference; a belt clip/J hook that allows five cant positions with a simple turn clockwise/counterclockwise; a sweat guard to buffer between the firearm and your body, to assist with better purchase of the firearm and to offer a degree of ventilation, without allowing sweat to pass to the slide of your firearm (the sweat guard is detachable and you may use the holster without it); a rigid paddle that enables to carry the holster as OWB; <strong>and finally, the holster is ambidextrous and may be switched to left-hand use without any tools required.</strong>  The APN holster is highly concealable, very lightweight, completely washable, ventilated, highly durable, it is contoured for maximum comfort, and is extremely convenient for everyday concealed carry.</div>
\n<div><strong>The APN EZ and APN T2</strong> <strong>do not work with the</strong> <strong>APN concealment wing</strong>.</div>
\n<div></div>
\n<div><strong>How to use </strong></div>
\n<div>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside your pants, in a location of your preference. The holster may be used for appendix carry or for standard IWB carry on your waist. Make sure the belt clip is outside your pants and over your belt, while its lower hook is catching the belt from underneath.
\n
\nIf using a J hook (belt clip), make sure it goes first over your pants (between your pants and the backside of your belt) and then catches the belt from underneath. If using a paddle, make sure to dismantle the belt clip and sweat-guard first. Then click the paddle into the sweat-guard location. Place the holster on your hip and make sure the paddle is pushed all the way down on your belt.

\n<strong>Mechanical Recoil Reduction System for STI DVC Classic Bushing</strong>
\n
\nThe Mechanical Recoil Reduction System is a direct replacement for the stock recoil rod and does not change the configuration of the pistol. This system works due to the multi spring intricate rod (3 springs) and controls the functionality of the pistol. The third spring which is contained within the rod controls the movement of the slide so it never rams on the frame.
\n
\nThe system includes 1 adjustable spring plug and 3 different external springs. The adjustable spring plug offers a different buffer force (slide full open position) and the external springs differentiate only the slide closed position (slide on the battery).
\n
\nDetailed instructions for installation also included. The external springs are different in length, the long spring is heavy and the short is light so the shooter can fine tune the pistol on the opening and locking position (slide on the battery) according his/hers personal standards.

\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A910AC"">The Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well for GLOCK 19 GEN 3 is a high performance, purpose-built Glock frame magazine well. It was designed to enhance and ensure positive magazine insertion in high stress scenarios. Its sleek and ergonomic design features also provide excellent concealment and ensure minimal printing to the user's clothing. Ramp and edge geometry allow for the smooth removal of faulty or stuck magazines during reloading or immediate action events.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A910BA"">The Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well is optimized for use with standard capacity Glock factory magazines, Magpul GL magazines, and a variety of aftermarket floorplates and extensions that are available for both. Recent generations of reduced capacity (10 rd) factory Glock magazines have several dimensional differences which may interfere with any magazine well, including the Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well. Some large aftermarket floorplates may also interfere.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A910D5"">Due to inherent variances in Glock frame production, if an excessively tight fit is experienced during the installation of an Enhanced Magazine Well that requires excessive force it is recommended that a professional gunsmith complete the installation to mitigate the potential for frame damage.</span>

\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A554FD"">The Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well for GLOCK 19 GEN 4 is a high performance, purpose-built Glock frame magazine well. It was designed to enhance and ensure positive magazine insertion in high stress scenarios. Its sleek and ergonomic design features also provide excellent concealment and ensureg minimal printing to the user's clothing. Ramp and edge geometry allow for the smooth removal of faulty or stuck magazines during reloading or immediate action events.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A5550E"">The Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well is optimized for use with standard capacity Glock factory magazines, Magpul GL magazines, and a variety of aftermarket floorplates and extensions that are available for both. Recent generations of reduced capacity (10 rd) factory Glock magazines have several dimensional differences which may interfere with any magazine well, including the Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well. Some large aftermarket floorplates may also interfere.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A5551F"">The Magpul GL Enhanced Magazine Well for Glock 17 Gen 4 and Glock 19 Gen 4 are <strong><em>not</em></strong> compatible as delivered out of the box with optional factory Glock Modular Back Straps. While end user modification is minor and may be attempted, it is taken at the user's risk.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5A55530"">Due to inherent variances in Glock frame production, if an excessively tight fit is experienced during the installation of an Enhanced Magazine Well that requires excessive force it is recommended that a professional gunsmith be utilized to complete the installation to mitigate the potential for frame damage.</span>

\nThe MS1® Sling is the most versatile addition to the Magpul® line of rifle slings. Built around our MS1 slider, this system provides rapid adjustments to either lengthen or shorten the sling with no slipping once it's set, with no tails, loops, or other potential snag hazards. The MS1 allows easy shoulder transitions, rapid adjustability for hands-free rifle carry and shooting support from various positions. The MS1 system also has a series of adapters that are sold separately and based on the MS3® and MS4™ slings. By adding the appropriate adapter for the sling (such as our Paraclip™, QDM or QD Sling Swivel), you can easily configure your MS1 for your fit and carry needs.
\n
\nIn testing, the sling had to survive tens of thousands of cycles in wet, dry and sandy conditions, static load testing without slippage for 72 hours and weighted six foot dynamic drop tests. In addition to the controlled lab tests, we also swam it, jumped it, hunted with it, hiked into the mountains with it, and most importantly shot with it in a variety of rugged field conditions.
\n
\nThe MS1 Sling is fully Berry Amendment compliant.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\n
\nThe MS3 Multi-Mission Sling System was designed to give a versatile weapon-retention solution for a multitude of tactical environments and missions. As a standalone product, the rapidly-convertible MS3 allows an operator to leverage the maneuverability of one-point attachment for direct action, or two-point attachment for stability. Single-hand adjustments and quick-release, positive-locking hardware provide flexibility and durability in a truly adaptable sling system.
\n
\nUsed in conjunction with the optional Magpul ASAP® plate, the MS3 sling enables seamless transitions into an array of shooting positions without getting bound or fouled. The MS3 concept allows switching from Weapon Shoulder to Reaction Shoulder for shooting around corners, under vehicles, or to minimize exposure. The MS3 can also increase operator survivability by keeping the weapon in the fight in case of injury to the operator's shoulder, arm, or hand. The MS3 GEN2 incorporates a new low profile quick-adjust slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless, sling adjustment. Webbing length has also been increased for a comfortable fit with all body types and armor configurations.
\n
\nMade in U.S.A. and 100% Berry Amendment compliant.

\nFilling the same mission requirement as the standard MS3 Sling, the MS3 Single QD can quickly switch between one-point and two-point configuration. The MS3 Single QD maintains material construction and specifications identical to that of the standard MS3, but features a heavy-duty push-button QD Sling Swivel for the one-point (rear) weapon attachment rather than the Magpul Paraclip™.
\n
\nThis modification allows compatibility with QD sling cups commonly found on lower receivers, receiver end plates, and buttstocks. The MS3 Single QD GEN2 incorporates a new low profile quick-adjust Slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless, sling adjustment. Webbing length has also been increased for a comfortable fit with all body types and armor configurations.

\n
\nBuilding on the heritage and proven performance of Magpul's MS Sling series, the Magpul RLS (Rifleman Loop Sling) is a durable, lightweight, and affordable shooting aid and retention device. Combining the best features of Rhodesian and 1907 match-style slings, the RLS was created with Magpul's famous proprietary nylon mesh webbing and high-strength polymer hardware.
\n
\nIn a retention role, the RLS serves dutifully as an unobtrusive weapon sling and retention device, securely keeping the rifle tucked behind the shoulder. When called upon, the RLS is rapidly employed with the adjustable forward loop gripping the riflemans support arm, locking in a steady shooting position and firmly planting the rifle butt against the shoulder.
\n
\nThe Magpul RLS was designed with mobility in mind. At a mere 4.4 oz, the optimized weight of the RLS doesnt add unnecessary ounces to the rifle and weighs less than many competing slings and straps. Like all Magpul slings, the RLS has been extensively tested to its limit to ensure reliability and performance in wet, dry, and sandy conditions, to include load and drop testing. Its been hiked with, biked with, swam, climbed, hunted and shot (a lot) with in a variety of field conditions.
\n
\nThe American-made Magpul RLS combines legendary Magpul innovation, quality, and design into a simple and effective shooting aid for less money than many slings that merely carry a rifle. Available in BLK or COY.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\nTubular construction eliminates harsh edges that can rub or snag and provides double layers of cushioned comfort against the end user while shouldered
\n
\nDuring employment, the strap’s smooth texture remains comfortable, even when torqued against the user’s arm

\nLike all Magpul slings, colored webbing is NIR treated to reduce infrared signature

\n
\nThe MBUS (Magpul® Back-Up Sight) Pro is a corrosion-resistant all-steel back-up sighting solution that delivers maximum functionality and strength with minimum bulk at a price that's even smaller than its size.
\n
\nThe dual aperture, windage adjustable rear and no-tool, elevation adjustable front excel in all 1913 Picatinny rail mounting applications, including rail-height gas blocks. Positive detents keep the MBUS Pro Front and Rear at standard AR sight height when deployed, and so low when they are stowed that you'll never notice them until they're needed. Narrow width front sight is compatible with most IR aiming laser and light installations for the professional user.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\nBuilding on the proven MBUS Pro platform, the MBUS Pro Offset Sights are part of an an effective aiming system to supplement magnified optics on M1913 Picatinny mounting surfaces. In the event of a damaged or nonfunctional primary optic, or a close target, rotating the rifle 45 degrees provides the shooter with a fully-featured iron sighting solution.
\n
\nThe MBUS Pro Offset Rear Sight features durable Melonited steel construction, positive detented lockup when deployed, tool-less windage adjustment for easy zeroing, dual rear apertures, and a low profile footprint to ensure compatibility and reduce interference with most rifle setups.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\nThe new MBUS Pro LR capitalizes on the low profile and sleek styling of the original MBUS Pro, while adding the additional feature of an elevation adjustment wheel to accurately engage targets at variable distances.
\n
\nWith its all steel construction, this is the sighting solution that delivers no-tool adjustments, maximum strength, corrosion resistance, and functionality in a compact package. Positive detents keep the MBUS Pro LR at standard AR sight height when deployed and so low when stowed that you will hardly notice them.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5C0A354"">The Magpul SL Grip Module is a high-strength, injection-molded polymer grip module for HK94/93/91 &amp; Semi Shelf HK Clones*. Designed with improved ergonomics, a non-slip texture, and a modern aesthetic, the SL Grip Module brings numerous enhancements without sacrificing the iconic silhouette of the firearm.  </span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F5C0A363"">Containing innovations found in our other grips, the SL Grip Module provides increased firearm control with a TSP texture and easier to access fire control components through an optimized grip angle. HK ""Navy-style"" pictograph markings give a clear indication of the selector position while the MIAD®/MOE® Lube Bottle Core provides a 1/2 oz. bottle to keep weapons lubricant close at hand. Compatibility with other MIAD/MOE Grip Cores (sold separately) allows additional options to store critical items. The combination of our high-strength polymer and corrosion-resistant steel components provide proven Magpul reliability. </span>

\n<div class=""value"">
\n
\nStrike Industries is proud to introduce a revolutionary new product The Universal (Optics) Mount for GLOCK™. It has the lowest height-over-bore mount in the industry without the hassle of cutting your slide or cost of buying an aftermarket slide! We have put many hours and 1000's of rounds down range with most of the more popular red dot optics on the market with no problems whatsoever! This includes the Burris* Fast* Fire* II &amp; III, Leupold* Delta Point* reflex sights, Docters* II &amp; III, EoTech* MRDS*, Trijicon* RMR,* Vortex Venom and Viper, and many others. The mount itself is secured to the slide via the dove tail with 6 set screws. Two in the dovetail cut and one forward and aft of the dovetail and two more to prevent any shift. This provides a steady, sturdy and rugged mount that will repeatedly hold zero. Other mounting hardware included is 6mm, 8mm and 10mm screws (two of each) that are used to fit and secure most of the popular optics out there. (Depending on what optic you have you will need to find the screws that correlates with your particular optic. There are two special screws for Trijicon RMR. Once you secured the GUM to your slide and found the correct post ( two sets of reinforcing post included) for your optic, go ahead and mount your optic on the post and use the final two longer securing screws to secure your optic to the GUM.

\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F59069AC"">The Magpul M-LOK AFG (Angled Fore Grip) is the result of research and refinements done to the original AFG and AFG-2. By integrating the direct-attach M-LOK mounting system with minimalist construction, we were able to produce a high strength grip that only weighs 1.2 ounces, including hardware. </span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F59069BB"">Allowing for a wider range of mounting location options, the M-LOK AFG is ¾"" shorter than the AFG-2, while maintaining a similar gripping surface area. Even though the M-LOK AFG is more compact than its predecessors, it takes into account natural body mechanics to provide a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the M-LOK AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.</span>

\nQuickly reconfigurable between one-point and two-point operation, the Magpul® MS4 QDM Sling enhances the proven MS4 Dual QD Sling Gen2 by including factory-installed Magpul QDM quick-disconnect swivels. As a heavy-duty replacement for the typical push-button swivel, the Magpul QDM offers an innovative low-profile design, single-handed manipulation, a superior corrosion-resistant Melonite® finish, and a high-strength, freely rotating bale that canalizes sling webbing to prevent rollover. This sling system not only provides the strength, speed and security of Magpul QDM hardware, but also maintains compatibility with the standard QD sling cup interface found on many handguards, lower receivers, receiver end plates and buttstocks.
\n
\nBased on the streamlined two-point MS1® Sling adjustment system, the Magpul MS4 QDM Sling retains the low-profile quick-adjust slider which minimizes bulk and allows for secure, yet effortless adjustment. Webbing length is optimized for a comfortable fit with all body types and body armor configurations.
\n
\nThe Magpul MS4 QDM Sling is made in the U.S.A. and is fully Berry Amendment compliant.

\nThe MBUS Pro (Magpul® Back-Up Sight) is a corrosion-resistant all-steel back-up sighting solution that delivers maximum functionality and strength with minimum bulk at a price that's even smaller than its size.
\n
\nThe dual aperture, windage adjustable Rear and no-tool, elevation adjustable Front Sights excel in all 1913 Picatinny rail mounting applications, including rail-height gas blocks. Positive detents keep the MBUS Pro Front and Rear at standard AR sight height when deployed, and so low when they are stowed that you'll never notice them until they're needed. Narrow width Front is compatible with most IR aiming laser and light installations for the professional user.
\n
\nMade in the USA.

\nPacked with useful subtension data for long-range competition shooting or hunting, the EBR-7C is a hashmarked ranging reticle available in first focal plane. A windage tree in the lower two quadrants is perfect for fast follow-up corrections for both wind and elevation. Unique to the 7C, the numbers on the lower stadia have moved to the outside of the windage dots for less obstruction around the vertical stadia itself.

\nThe Diamondback Tactical is a long-range wolf in sheep's clothing. Rather than cramming features in at the expense of turret performance and optical quality, the Diamondback Tactical dials it back, putting the focus where it counts. Exposed turrets bring tracking performance previously unheard of at this price point, while its optical system delivers sharp image quality even at extended range. Its relatively simple design places you firmly in the driver's seat with the potential to take on that 1,000 yard mark and beyond, all at a price that's easy to justify for new shooters, your training rifle, as well as experienced shooters looking for a back-to-basics optic on their fun gun. Opt for one of the first focal plane models on a sweet shooting rifle and you've got yourself a perfectly capable competition rig without breaking the bank.

\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>How to use</strong>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside the pants and its belt clip over the belt. Make sure the belt clip is gripping the belt.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>About the Holster</strong>
\n
\nIt is an IWB holster that is as comfortable as it is rugged. No metal components, no moving parts, a one-piece lean polymer body. The reinforced injection-molded polymer construction makes it extremely lightweight and low profile. The slim, minimal sweat guard provides an effective barrier between your body and the firearm while, at the same, allowing you to rapidly holster and unholster when needed. The 43C holster is carried with a fully tuckable C clip. It should be worn at 3, 4 or 5 o'clock position.
\n
\n<strong>Warning! After wearing it for five minutes you'll likely forget it's there.</strong>

\n
\nThe PMAG 30 AR 300 B GEN M3 is a purpose-designed magazine for rifles chambered in 300 Blackout® (300 BLK). Since its inception, 300 BLK shooters have had to use a magazine designed for another cartridge, limiting its ultimate performance and compatibility. One of the key features of 300 BLK is the compatibility with 5.56x45mm parts, but with the magazine, it is a compromise to do so. Due to the wide variety of projectile weights and profiles potentially decreasing overall reliability, a dedicated 300 BLK magazine was a logical step for the PMAG line.
\n
\nIn addition to the performance gained by a dedicated mag, the PMAG 30 AR 300 B also offers a safer way to feed your 300 BLK rifle. When using 5.56x45mm mags, the potential to chamber and fire a 300 BLK round in a 5.56x45mm rifle with catastrophic results requires diligent ammunition management by the shooter. The PMAG 30 AR 300 B’s distinct rib design and smoother upper-half texture provides the shooter a distinct visual and tactile difference from any other PMAG to mitigate dangerous cross-loading issues.
\n
\nAlong with optimized 300 Blackout performance, the PMAG 30 AR 300 B incorporates all of the GEN M3 features such as our next-generation impact and crush resistant polymer, aggressive front and rear texture, an easily removable slim floor plate, a paint pen dot matrix for marking and identification, and a dust/impact cover.

\nThe next-generation PMAG 10 GEN M3 is a true 10-round polymer magazine for AR15/M4 compatible weapons chambered in 5.56x45 NATO / .223 Remington. Along with an expanded feature set and compatibility, the GEN M3 incorporates new material technology and manufacturing processes for enhanced strength, durability, and reliability. The PMAG 10 provides next-generation performance for those needing lower profile magazines.
\n
\nWhile the GEN M3 is optimized for Colt-spec AR15/M4 platforms, modified internal and external geometry also permits operation with a range of additional weapons such as the HK® 416/MR556A1/M27 IAR, British SA-80, FN® SCAR™ MK 16/16S, and others.
\n
\nThe PMAG 10 GEN M3 features a long-life stainless steel spring, four-way anti-tilt follower for reliable feeding, and an easy to disassemble flared floorplate to aid extraction and handling of the magazine while providing improved drop protection. A redesigned bolt catch notch in the rear of the magazine provides increased bolt catch clearance, while an over-travel stop on the spine helps ensure the magazine will not over-insert on compatible weapons. In addition, an included pop-off impact / dust cover can optionally be used to minimize debris intrusion and protect against potential damage to the top cartridge during storage and transit.

9122,simple,SI-ATUM-ULTRAX36,"STRIKE INDUSTRIES AntiVenom ULTRA Gun Oil",1,0,visible,,"Introducing the next level of our AntiVenom line of weapons maintenance solutions: AntiVenom Ultra. Powered by XPLC, AntiVenom ULTRA is a heavy duty lubricant for extreme environments, optimized for the most demanding select fire and suppressed automatic weapon systems.  An ionized molecular complex bonds to metallic microstructures, migrates <em>towards</em> friction zones, and withstands high pressures and operating temperatures.  A higher viscosity and film strength serve to increase surface tenacity and boundary thickness.  Maximum friction reduction is achieved between -60ºF and 550ºF.  However, when applied to a weapon recently cleaned with XPLC, ULTRA is capable of temporary performance in environments from -80ºF to 810ºF.  Like XPLC, ULTRA is hydrophobic, and wood and polymer safe.
\n
\n<strong>Package include</strong>
\n- 1x Squeeze bottle (4oz.)
\n
\n<strong>Features:</strong>
\n- Synergistic performance enhancement when used with XPLC
\n- Ultra high film strength
\n- Dielectric (Safe for electrical contacts)
\n- Migrates <em>towards</em> heat and friction
\n- Highest in class operating temperature range
\n- Wood and Polymer safe
\n- Ideal for SBR's and suppressed rifles and machineguns
\n- Will not gum up in extremely cold environments
\n- Contains no harsh industrial additives
\n- Made in USA!
\n
\n<strong>Directions:</strong>
\n1 - Apply light coat to pins, sears,bolts and carriers, or where heavy lubrication is indicated. (Shiny spots on finish)
\n2 - Lubricates immediately.  For best results, apply thin layer over a surface prepared with AntiVenom XPLC.
\n3 - Leave visible layer on parts that experience high friction and/or show signs of excessive wear.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,,,,,1,,,0,"Handgun Parts & Kits, Rifle Parts & Kits",,,"https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ATUM.jpg, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/ATUM.jpg",,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,default,122,30,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2024-10-21 05:33:51",,,,,,,,,,,,,,

9699,variable,SM26043,"SIGHTMARK Mini Shot M-Spec M1 LQD Reflex Sight",1,0,visible,,"Built for law enforcement officers and professionals, the compact Mini Shot M-Spec LQD is the perfect reflex sight for competition shooting, hunting and LE applications on shotguns, pistols and AR’s. The kit includes a low profile QD mount for shotguns and pistols along with a riser QD mount for AR platform rifles. This rugged optic is 100% waterproof and features a durable aluminum housing with a steel protective shield. Doubling the battery life of the competition, the Mini Shot M-Spec’s extremely low power consumption provides 300-30,000 hours of battery life on one CR1632 battery, while its 12 hour auto shutoff prevents the unit from running out of batteries while you’re not using it. Easy 1 MOA windage and elevation click adjustments make zeroing this 3 MOA red dot reticle a breeze, even without any special tools. 10 brightness levels give shooters perfect reticle options from low light situations to the brightest days. An ambidextrous digital switch allows the M-Spec to be easily turned on and off by both left and right handed shooters.

\nIf you’re on the hunt for the perfect go-to laser rangefinder for bow and rifle hunters alike, you’ve found it in the Crossfire™ HD 1400. The Crossfire™ HD 1400 has everything you need and nothing you don’t. With a 1,400-yard max range (750 on deer), you get plenty of power to range and, thanks to the HD optical system, you’ll have the power to pick apart any landscape. To match any hunting environment, the Crossfire™ HD 1400 has three target modes (Normal, First, Last) and two ranging modes (HCD and LOS). A red TOLED display keeps the readout clear in any lighting conditions and, at just 4.8 ounces, the Crossfire™ HD 1400 hunts hard and carries light.

\nThe Sig Cross rifles ship with a Magpul PMAG 5 7.62 AC that has a proprietary sled follower for optimized single-round loading through the ejection port. The standard PMAG 5 7.62 AC (MAG549) and PMAG 5 7.62 AC (MAG579) are compatible with the Sig Cross, and feeding performance will be the same from the Sig Cross OEM Magpul magazine or the standard Magpul PMAG 7.62 AC magazines.
\n
\nThe PMAG 10 7.62 AC magazine is optimized for the .308 Winchester based family of cartridges and is compatible with short action AICS-spec bottom metal, to include the Bolt Action Magazine Well for the Hunter 700 Stock, and in most platforms performs exceptionally well in similar, but non-.308 based cartridges, such as 6.5 Creedmoor. While other rifle platforms, such as the Ruger American Rifle®, can be upgraded for use with AICS-spec bottom metal and magazines, the internal design features may present some feeding and reliability concerns when used with the standard PMAG 10 7.62 AC magazine in non-.308 based calibers.
\n
\nAs such, Magpul does not recommend the PMAG 10 7.62 AC for calibers other than .308-based cartridges in the Ruger American Rifle® in the Hunter American stock, and results may vary in other actions with 3-lug bolts. For optimal feeding and reliability with the Hunter American in cartridges like 6.5 Creedmoor, it is recommended to utilize only the updated Magpul PMAG 5 7.62 AC, easily identified with its brown lock plate and follower for complete Magpul reliability.</td>

\nThe original PMAG 5 7.62 AC magazine, identified by its green lock plate and follower, was optimized for the .308 Winchester based family of cartridges and is compatible with short action AICS-spec bottom metal, to include the Bolt Action Magazine Well for the Hunter 700 Stock, and performed well with most non-.308 based cartridges in nearly all applications. Some three lug bolt action rifle platforms, such as the Ruger American Rifle®, presented some occasional feeding concerns when used with the standard green follower PMAG 5 7.62 AC magazine. We have made an inline change to a new design of spring and follower. The revised PMAG 5 7.62 AC magazine, easily identified with its brown lock plate and follower, has been optimized to ensure complete Magpul reliability with a broad range of calibers in the Ruger American Rifle® and other 3-lug bolt designs, while maintaining or improving the proven Magpul reliability in Remington® 700 footprint platforms and other 2-lug bolt action designs. For the Hunter American stock, we recommend using only the new, brown follower magazines, in calibers like 6.5 Creedmoor. All other actions, and the Ruger in .308, can use either version interchangeably.</td>

\n
\nOur Glock extended slide release adds surface area and a raised texture that greatly improves usability for all! It is the perfect upgrade for conceal carry AND competition. Never again will your thumb slip while manipulating your Glock slide release!
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>What is it?</strong> This drop-in replacement Glock extended slide stop release lever has a surface area extended over the OEM size. It arrives fully assembled with spring and is offered for multiple Glock models.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>Why use it? </strong>One of the main flaws of the Glock Factory release lever is that it offers very little surface area and/or texture. This results in the operator occasionally slipping when attempting to manipulate the lever. Our Glock slide release offers an extended AND raised surface area to ensure easy manipulation of the Glock slide. It is easy to install, functions great, and looks fantastic!

10354,variable,,"TYRANT DESIGNS P80 Magwell",1,0,visible,,"Guide your loaded magazine smoothly and quickly into the Polymer80 pistol’s grip with the sleek P80 Magwell from Tyrant Designs. Made of high quality materials, these carefully designed magwells make it so easy that with just a little practice you can load a fresh magazine without ever looking at the pistol. Win competitions or defend yourself better with those added seconds.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>Increase your reloading speed</strong>
\n
\nIn a competition, it can come down to microseconds. Speed is essential, no matter what the scenario, especially the time lapse between magazine changes. The enhanced ergonomics of our P80 Magwell,, will increase your loading speeds. Forward relief cuts provide comfort, and an aggressive funnel ensures your reloads will be quick and successful. You’ll never fumble a magazine change again. In an emergency situations, fumbles are the difference between life and death. In those events, these microseconds are even more important, and you never want to question if being faster might help in a self-defense scenario.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>How it all works</strong>
\n
\nThe magwell adapter flairs out to create a wider opening to guide the magazine into the firearm. Shaped like a funnel, it cuts down on the fumbling and the need for an exact aim to get the magazine into the firearm. Less fumbling equals faster reload speed. Our Polymer80 compatible magwell also improves magazine change consistency.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>Designed to improve reloads</strong>
\n
\nMade of high-quality aluminum, these Magwells fit for the Polymer80 frame provide weight to help improve your reloads. This weight also provides balance for your P80. Never lose parts again with this one-piece design. Retention is more comfortable with a set screw, which is made of anodized aluminum. Functionality and retention are ensured by the underside cuts. Removal of faulty or stuck magazines will never be a problem because of ramp and edge geometry.
\n
\n<strong> </strong>
\n
\n<strong>Magwells made to fit Polymer80 frames</strong>
\n
\nThese Magwells offer the tightest fit in the industry. The magwells for the P80 are optimized for use with standard Glock factory magazines and a variety of aftermarket floor plates and extensions.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>Perfect for everyday carry</strong>
\n
\nThe design of these Magwells allow them to be perfect for competition, yet still sleek enough for every day. Because of the high-quality aluminum used, they add little bulk, which means they can still be used for concealed carry. The ergonomic design on these magwells for the P80 also means very little imprinting on your clothes so no one will ever know you are carrying unless you want them to.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\nIf you want to ramp up your magazine change speed, cut down on fumbles, or improve your over all consistency, these Glock Magwells are the way to go. You’ll never worry about those precious seconds spent making magazine change again.

Having an outstanding optical performance over the entire magnification range, it is perfect for identifying even small targets or spotting your results. In addition it can be equipped with our Multi Turn II (MT II) turret with fine 0.5 cm/100 m click value for precise zeroing and more accurate shooting. This is why it has become more popular among ambitious competition shooters and military units alike.

The low-profile elevation turret with a large 35 MRAD adjustment range can easily be combined with a red dot sight for close distances. Especially compact rifles with limited rail space are predestined for this compact powerhouse. Although being short, lightweight and compact: this riflescope doesn’t compromise a millimeter on mechanical reliability or optical performance.

Although initially developed for and still in use by USSOCOM (United States Special Operations Command) for extreme long-range shooting it has proven to be very versatile: the 3-27x power range and parallax adjustment/side focus going down to 10 m can handle easily anything from a close, quick shot to long-range distances. This makes it very popular among police and military units alike.

10783,variable,677-911,"SCHMIDT BENDER 5-25x56 PM II/LP",1,0,visible,,"The 5-25x56 PM II model is setting the benchmark for the industry in terms of optical quality and mechanical reliability. Due to its great magnification range and well-engineered performance it is very popular among military/police units as well as competition shooters which are demanding the best of the best.
\n
\nThe 5-25x56 PM II/LP is the most popular specification of the 5-25x56 PM II. It is largely in use in military/police units around the globe. Also among competition shooters this scope is standard due to its universal use with big magnification and an extremely comprehensive total adjustment range. The Double Turn elevation turret is one of our most popular and sought-after turret designs. It provides a visible rotational indicator and has two rotational settings. The indicator changes colour during the transition to the second rotation from black to yellow, which corresponds to the yellow font on the turret. It is ideally capable of providing the adjustment travel needed for long-range shots. The precise parallax compensation with an engraved meter index, is going as close as 10 m/11 yd until up to infinity. The 5-25x56 PM II/LP has a large reticle choice in first or in second focal plane. In a 5-25x56 PM II/LP riflescope, none other can truly compare!

\n
\nPROTECTIVE GLASSES – Safeguard your eyes with these sports glasses, crafted for hunting &amp; shooting activities, acting as a barrier against ejected casings, blowback &amp; recoil; These shooting glasses also feature UV protection for comprehensive eye care.
\n
\nALL-DAY COMFORT – With an adjustable frame and nose pad these hunting glasses allow for seamless customization, ensuring a personalized fit every time; Say goodbye to foggy lenses with our innovative design that promotes airflow, keeping your vision clear.
\n
\nIMPROVE YOUR ACCURACY – With different lens tints available, shooters can effectively manage light &amp; enhance color contrast for better target acquisition; Darker tints are ideal for bright sunlight, while lighter tints are ideal for low-light conditions.
\n
\nCLEAR/GRAY LENSES<br role=""presentation"" data-uw-rm-sr="""" />Gray is the “all-around” color. Gray lenses reduce the amount of light around you, allowing you to see a balanced tone of color. It’s ideal for bright conditions and helps you get a level sense of contrast and depth.
\n
\nAMBER LENSES<br role=""presentation"" data-uw-rm-sr="""" />Block blue-light and work best in low light, cloudy days. The amber tint creates an excellent contrast between colors, helping the target’s orange stand out to you, even on those dreary days.
\n
\nYELLOW LENSES<br role=""presentation"" data-uw-rm-sr="""" />Tend to block out “blue light,” such as the diffused haze on a cloudy day, but bring out the orange color of a practice target. These colors increase your contrast and depth perception, which improves accuracy.

\n<div><strong>About the Holster</strong></div>
\n<div>APN is an IWB and OWB holster designed for appendix carry or standard I/OWB carry on your waist. The holster is offered with an adjustment screw for accurate retention pressure and personal preference; a belt clip/J hook that allows five cant positions with a simple turn clockwise/counterclockwise; a sweat guard to buffer between the firearm and your body, to assist with better purchase of the firearm and to offer a degree of ventilation, without allowing sweat to pass to the slide of your firearm (the sweat guard is detachable and you may use the holster without it); a rigid paddle that enables to carry the holster as OWB; <strong>and finally, the holster is ambidextrous and may be switched to left-hand use without any tools required.</strong>  The APN holster is highly concealable, very lightweight, completely washable, ventilated, highly durable, it is contoured for maximum comfort, and is extremely convenient for every day concealed carry.</div>
\n<div><strong>The APN EZ and APN T2</strong> <strong>do not work with the</strong> <strong>APN concealment wing</strong>.</div>
\n<div></div>
\n<div></div>
\n<div><strong>How to use </strong></div>
\n<div>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside your pants, in a location of your preference. The holster may be used for appendix carry or for standard IWB carry on your waist. Make sure the belt clip is outside your pants and over your belt, while its lower hook is catching the belt from underneath.
\n
\nIf using a J hook (belt clip), make sure it goes first over your pants (between your pants and the backside of your belt) and then catches the belt from underneath. If using a paddle, make sure to dismantle the belt clip and sweat-guard first. Then click the paddle into the sweat-guard location. Place the holster on your hip and make sure the paddle is pushed all the way down on your belt.

\nThe Viper PST Gen II hands an unfair advantage to shooters who seek to keep the upper hand in every situation from close quarters to long-range shots. The illumination dial is cleanly integrated into the side focus adjustment knob for easy access and streamlined performance. The glass-etched reticle offers shooters highly functional, intuitive, and detailed hold points, yet remains uncluttered for optimal viewing and features 10 intensity levels with off positions between each setting.

\n
\n<strong>A sighting system so powerful, you can see the next 100 years.</strong>
\n
\n<strong>Part Red-Dot sight. Part On-board intelligence for the modern marksman.</strong>
\n
\nMore than a red dot sight, it’s command central for any training or personal defense mission you face.
\n
\nThese revolutionary new optical sights provide superhuman situational awareness with a real-time data feed in your field of view, including a leveler, compass heading, and more. Bluetooth connectivity creates radical efficiencies like instant access to more than 20 reticles and up to 10 personal firearm profiles, while our DoubleShoot™ App provides automatic digital zeroing when you upload an image of your target, key performance data, and more. It’s the missing link of intelligence between marksman and machine. The only thing missing is you.

\nThe MS1 Padded Sling is an optimized, dedicated two-point sling that serves equally well in a one-point role when using optional adapters. Built around our MS1 slider, this system provides rapid adjustments to either lengthen or shorten the sling with no slipping once set, and no tails, loops, or other potential snag hazards. In a two-point role, the MS1 allows easy shoulder transitions, rapid adjustability for hands free rifle carry and shooting support from various positions. The MS1 system also has a series of adapters that are sold separately and based on the MS3® and MS4™ slings. By adding the appropriate adapter (available with Paraclip™ or QD Sling Swivel) for the sling, you can easily add one-point functionality to your MS1.

\n<h3><strong>INTRODUCING THE ALL NEW CAA USA GEN3 CHARGING HANDLE FOR THE MCK (MICRO CONVERSION KIT)</strong></h3>
\nThis charging handle will fit the majority of Glocks including aftermarket slides with the exclusion of the 42,43,43X &amp; 48 which will follow in the future along with models for Smith &amp; Wesson, Springfield, Taurus, CZ USA and many more. This new MCK charging handle features an innovative 2 piece design consisting of a precision engineered, small footprint slide cover plate and a threaded screw-in knurled charging handle that can be used on either the right or left side depending on need. One of the BEST features of the GEN 3 charger is that it is completely backwards compatible. That’s right, you can use the charging handle on all 3 generations of Glock MCK! Gone are the days of stripped out charging handles and being stuck using your OEM slide. The GEN 3 allows you to use any aftermarket slide you want with your MCK making the possibilities endless! Want to use your pistol outside the MCK? Simply unscrew the handle and you’re good to go! You can keep the rear plate in or switch it back at will. See included instructions for simple installation.

\n
\n<strong>Included in the pack</strong>
\n<ul>
\n 	<li> A new CAA USA Steel back plate for the slide</li>
\n 	<li>A knurled screw in handle that can be used on either side</li>
\n 	<li>GEN 3 Charging Handle Instruction Sheet</li>
\n</ul>
\nWith the GEN 3’s direct connection to the slide it negates the need for relying on the slide serrations. This means those wishing to use the Glocks with “C” style serrations and even the Glock 44 can finally enjoy all the full advantages of the MCK platform. Most similar designs for extended charging handles on the market utilize a fixed position non-removable handle which can create fitment issues when it comes to storage or holstering.

\n<blockquote>The MCK Gen 3 will take America and the world by storm, and even though the MCK Gen 1, and 2 become the most popular conversion kit in the world. We truly believe the Gen 3 will out do them both. Come join the MCK Family and be one of the first to own the revolution MCK Gen 3.</blockquote>
\nWhen designing the MCKGEN3 we at CAA USA tried to take into account all of the comments we have received from you our loyal customers. This valuable input was essential when designing the MCKGEN3. Our new “CAR-WASH” cleaning system, with a radically changed charging handle and the ability to give our customers the option to use their Micro Red Dot slide mounted optic while inserted into the MCKGEN3, will bring the MCK to even greater heights than the Gen 1 or Gen 2. We truly believe the MCKGEN3 will take America and the world by storm as did the Gen 1 and Gen 2. Reaffirming that the MCK is the most popular Conversion Kit ever made. We are extremely proud that the MCKGEN3 as well as the rest of the MCK family is made 100% in the USA.

\n<h3><strong>ADVANTAGES OF THE NEW GEN 3 MCK</strong></h3>
\n<ul>
\n 	<li>For the first time, the MCK can accept a slide with a micro red dot/RMR mounted on it.</li>
\n 	<li>The shooter can also aim with their zeroed RMR while using the Gen 3. No need for an additional optic.</li>
\n 	<li>Built-in handgun cleaning solution, utilizing a brush/bristle system. The robust bristles clean the front of the slide during cycling. Carbon buildup is no longer an issue. All while not affecting the finish of your pistol.</li>
\n 	<li>Ships with a new ambidextrous stabilizer/stock option allowing for right and or left side folding (in the past, only right)</li>
\n 	<li>The Gen 3 stabilizer/stock has two height options. In the lower position when shooting with RMR/slide mounted optic or in the upper position when using any type of iron sights/pop-up sights or any red dot/optic on top picatinny rail.</li>
\n 	<li>A new front adapter shields the inside of the MCK from carbon buildup and is easily removed and washed. Making cleaning easier than ever before. Simply remove, rinse, and get back to it.</li>
\n 	<li>4.6-inch Aluminum rear and front top picatinny rails to accommodate any optic or sighting preference.</li>
\n 	<li>The stabilizer features an external brush for cleaning the slide as well as a holder for the Gen 3 charging handle.</li>
\n 	<li>Ships with a new Gen 3 charging handle that utilizes a backplate for handguns with RMR/slide mounted optics, as well as a standard polymer Gen 2 handle for use when not using a slide mounted red dot.</li>
\n 	<li>The Gen 3 features all the Gen 2 advantages, including an aluminum top rail. Spare magazine holder with release button. Suppressor capable (increased to fit 1.56-inch diameter) and ability to fire with the stabilizer/stock folded.</li>

The Volta is powered by 2x AAA batteries and features solar cells directly on top of the optic, giving users the option to choose what works best for their situation. Volta red dots boast the Eclipse Light Management System, a revolutionary technology for red dots which automatically adjusts the red dot reticle’s brightness based on the shooter’s environment. The heavy-duty Volta’s covered design is tougher than open-style red dots and a scratch-resistant, anti-reflective lens coating adds even more durability. Other popular features include an adjustable-height mount, digital switch brightness controls, single side access to both windage and elevation adjustments, unlimited eye relief and shockproof design. All Volta red dots come standard with a protective rubber cover, low picatinny mount, absolute cowitness mount and Sightmark’s Lifetime Warranty.

Instantly change the magnification of your close-range optic from 1x to 5x by using the T-5’s flip-to-side mount. The magnifier’s streamlined, low drag design prevents it from snagging on clothing and equipment and makes the T-5 .7” shorter than the magnifier it’s replacing. Ideal for stretching your AR engagements out to 200 yards, an included LQD mount allows for rapid attaching/detaching in intense shooting situations. The T-5’s aluminum construction is shockproof up to .308 caliber rifles and provides IP55 water resistant protection. Brightness and resolution are improved from fully multi-coated optics and external windage and elevation adjustments help shooters align the reticle of their red dot/reflex sight to the center of the magnifier’s point of view. The Sightmark T-5 includes flip-to-side LQD mount, adjustment tools and manual.

A straight tube magnifier a full .8” shorter than the model it replaces, the T-3 features a streamlined, low drag design, preventing the magnifier from snagging on equipment in important situations. Ideal for engagements up to 100 yards, if a close-range shooting scenario calls for no magnification, simply use the T-3’s flip-to-side mount to rapidly transition between the optic systems. This durable magnifier is constructed of aluminum and provides improved brightness and resolution from fully multi-coated optics. External windage and elevation adjustments align the reticle to the center of the T-3’s point of view. EOTech® and Aimpoint® compatible, the locking quick detach mount found on the T-3 lets the magnifier be quickly removed. Sightmark T-3 Magnifiers include flip-to-side LQD mount, adjustment tools and manual.

\nReflecting the best of its Finnish heritage, the Finn Bear is ideal for use in the great outdoors, and makes an efficient utility knife as well! Its sub-zero quenched German 4116 Stainless blade is hollow ground and given an RC of 56-57 so it will hold its edge well while remaining easy to re-sharpen in the field. The Finn Bear has a sturdy point for piercing and plenty of belly for skinning and carving. It's big and strong enough to skin large game, yet thin and delicate enough to slice a tomato or cut an apple. The durable Polypropylene handle has a modified diamond cross-section that will fit your hand like a glove and accommodate a wide variety of gripping methods. To carry your knife safely and conveniently in the field, we are including a pouch-style versatile low profile polymer sheath that can be easily worn on a belt or tucked into your pack or tackle box.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,1,,,,1,,,700000,"COLD STEEL",,,"https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/232-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/232-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/241-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/251-1.png",,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,412,30,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-01-13 11:29:52",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\nThe Hide Out was designed as a small, inexpensive and super-functional neck knife. The resulting blade is a true featherweight, weighing a meager 1.9oz! Its high satin polished, double-edged Japanese AUS 8A blade is ""Scandi"" ground, which makes it very sharp and also very stiff, allowing for a strong and durable tip, despite its sharpness. Its full tang is encapsulated in a weather proof Kray-Ex handle that has been designed to be very thin and flat. The handle is subtly contoured and deeply checkered to give the hand great purchase and security on such a small, thin knife, while still enabling effortless transition between grips. A Secure-Ex sheath and bead chain lanyard allow you to wear this knife discreetly and comfortably all day long.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,1,,,,1,,,1000000,"COLD STEEL",,,"https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/311-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/311-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/321-1.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/331-1.png",,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,412,60,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"2025-01-13 11:30:54",,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Kiridashi is now used by practically everyone in Japan from children to master craftsmen! In many ways it's the fixed blade equivalent of the western pocket knife.

\nThe Cold Steel Kobun is a lightweight knife that takes its name from the Japanese underworld, where the word ""Kobun"" is sometimes used as an indicator of rank that suggests the word ""soldier""in, or one who takes orders from his ""Oyabun"" or boss. It's a fitting name for a knife like the Kobun, which was effectively designed to be ""a good soldier""in.

The locking control arm allows the shooter’s off-hand to lock the rifle at the desired vertical angle/tilt. With less than a ¼ of a turn, the locking control arm goes from allowing the rifle to freely rotate vertically to completely locking it down. Locking the rifle at the desired position allows for added stability when firing and greatly reduces shooter fatigue. With no comparisons the Reaper Grip maximizes proper shooting techniques outside of the supported prone position. The Reaper Grip is compatible with all tripods with a 3/8"" x 16, as well as 1/4""-20 (with included insert) threaded studs.

\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>How to use</strong>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside the pants, so that the holster shell is at the same height as your waistband. You may need to completely loosen your belt to do this. Make sure that both holster clips are gripping your belt from the outside, with their lower hooks inserted below the belt. You may move the holster forward and back to find the most convenient position on your waist.
\n

\n
\nTighten your belt to a point where you can feel retention when holstering, but the pistol can still be holstered without hitting the holster shell. Important: LaserTuck is a holster designed to accommodate various sub-compact single-stack pistols. It is not designed for a specific pistol but for multiple pistols, and does not have a standard passive retention mechanism holding the pistol. Retention is achieved by pressure of the belt on the holster when on your body; therefore, please refrain from inverting the holster when not on you. Your pistol will fall out.

\n<strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: <strong>The LaserTuck® DOES NOT have a passive retention mechanism. When not wearing the LaserTuck® with a holstered pistol, DO NOT invert the LaserTuck® as your pistol will fall out. RETENTION IS ONLY ATTAINED WHEN THE LASERTUCK® IS PROPERLY WORN ON THE BODY.

\n
\nHolster Material - mold Injected Polymer. IWB with surface retention - retention is achieved by the holster firmly gripping the pistol between belt tension on the holster shell on one side, and the flexible holster backing made with a mild non-slip surface on the opposite side.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\n<strong>How to use</strong>
\n
\nPlace the holster inside the pants, so that the holster shell is at the same height as your waistband. You may need to completely loosen your belt to do this. Make sure that both holster clips are gripping your belt from the outside, with their lower hooks inserted below the belt. You may move the holster forward and back to find the most convenient position on your waist.
\n
\n&nbsp;
\n
\nTighten your belt to a point where you can feel retention when holstering, but the pistol can still be holstered without hitting the holster shell. Important: IWBL is a universal holster for large-size pistols. It is not designed for a specific pistol but for multiple pistols and does not have a standard passive retention mechanism holding the pistol. Retention is achieved by pressure of the belt on the holster when on your body; therefore, please refrain from inverting the holster when not on you.

\nThe light is waterproof and has two modes of operation with two functions under each mode. A 3-position function switch allows you to turn the light on and select one of the two functions available. A dedicated mode switch toggles between the visible and IR modes to maintain illumination discipline.
\n
\nThe function switch features a nub below to allow checking the selected function by finger-feel even with gloves on. The mode switch has a smaller similar nub above, or you can just memorize ""Visible / Front"" and ""IR / Rear"" - assuming you mounted the light correctly. The light provides vibrating feedback to confirm it has been turned on in the IR mode.

\n
\nThe Strike Industries has added to its ever growing line of compatible GLOCK™ products with its SI Rear Sight Rail Adapter for the GLOCK™. The SI GSR is a tactical light weight, ultra sturdy, inexpensive solution for shooters wanting to add a rear sight to their Glock but don’t want to have to spend a huge sum of money to have one customized installed. It comes with a rail to mount any sight of your choice, screws to adjust height, and a back plate (Back Plate Locking System) to secure the rail and eliminate any movement from vibration. And if you choose to not use an optic, the rail has reference dots you can paint so you don’t have to remove the rail. For the competitive shooter, the rail is also compatible w/ a separately sold ambidextrous charging handle. Strike is always striving to create innovative solutions to push the envelope and give the user what they want with the most available options possible and we feel that the SI GSR is exactly that kind of solution!

The FSB-XD was designed to increase durability between the areas of the metal slide and polymer frame while also decrease the amount of overall wear.

The relief gained will also decrease the shock to your hands which prevents muscle fatigue and allows for more control for the next shot. It is engineered with a retaining design to ensure buffer will be secured on the slide and has added extra cushion knobs for extra buffer.

\nThe Bore-Max Speed Jags &amp; Patches Multi-Cal Pack heralds a new era in firearm maintenance, delivering up to 4x more bore contact for superior cleaning results. This comprehensive system includes ten specially designed jags for both handguns and rifles, covering an impressive range of calibers from .22 to .45 for handguns and .22/.223 to .30/7.62mm for rifles. Each jag is nickel-plated, ensuring longevity and resistance to chemical breakdown. Paired perfectly with these jags are the Speed Jag Patches, engineered from micro-pore fibers to offer superior absorbency and a grit-grabbing surface texture. The patches are uniquely designed to conform to the jags, avoiding the issue of bunching and thus enabling deeper and faster cleaning of your bore. Together, this caliber-specific set brings efficiency to a new level, saving you both time and effort while ensuring your firearms are maintained in peak condition. Use caution: Speed Jags and Speed Jag Patches are compatible exclusively with each other and should not be used with standard jags or patches to prevent damage or less effective cleaning.

\nThe <strong>T-ThumbSmart holster from CYTAC</strong> is the ideal choice for official use as well as for shooting training and self-defense.
\n
\nMade from high-quality polymer, the holster is not only particularly robust, but also meets even military standards.
\n
\nThe well thought-out design also allows the weapon to be carried close to the body so that it can be easily concealed. The handedness is designed for right-handed people.
\n
\nAdjustable in height and equipped with a trigger guard locking system, the T-ThumbSmart holster ensures comfortable and safe handling. When the pistol is inserted into the holster, it is automatically locked and can be released again by pressing down the thumb lever.
\n
\nAlso included in delivery is a paddle, which can be converted into a belt loop by tightening the existing screws.

\nThe Tyrant Designs CNC Glock 43 &amp; 43x Compensator, known as the Glock 43 T-Comp, dramatically reduces muzzle rise and sensed recoil, allowing much quicker target re-acquisition. Compatible with ½-28 threaded barrels our compensator requires no modification to your 9mm Glock.. The G43 T-Comp works on all Glock 43's including the 43x and will function using almost any grain ammunition.
\n
\nThe real enginuity is in how the T-Comp is installed. Utilizing a two piece design our Glock comp installs securely in seconds WITHOUT the need for set screws or any other faulty attachment methods. Working on a concept focused on uncompromised innovation allowed considerable engineering freedom in developing significant solutions. Once attached, the Tyrant Compensator will not come loose while operating your firearm, or while holstering/unholstering it. Whether you are a range day goer or competitive shooter we are confident our Glock compensator not only outperforms the competition but sets a new standard for compensator innovation.

\nINFORCE has launched its latest iteration of weapon mounted lights with the WMLX White/IR Gen 3. The newest generation boasts superior brightness and power, providing more than twice the beam intensity of its predecessor on two 123a batteries. The 2-hour battery life remains unchanged, ensuring consistent performance for extended use in the field.
\n
\nWith a beam intensity of 900 lumens and a range of 656ft/200m, the WMLX White/IR Gen 3 offers exceptional visibility within a comfortable engagement range. This feature, combined with its ergonomic nonslip button, contoured to the shape of the human thumb, ensures that users can activate and deactivate the light intuitively and safely. Additionally, a flip safety prevents the device from being turned on until the user is ready.
\n
\nThe WMLX White/IR Gen 3 is suitable for close quarter engagements when mounted to a shotgun or pistol-caliber carbine, as well as mid-range shooting when clipped onto a rifle. Its construction with glass reinforced nylon, which is impervious to dirt, sand, or other solid debris, sets it apart from other models that may use cheaper plastic. The model is also waterproof up to 66 feet/20 meters, ensuring reliable performance in any conditions.
\n
\nThis lightweight and durable rifle light is perfect for any rifleman or hunter, and its exceptional features serve as a testament to INFORCE's commitment to quality and reliability. The WMLX White/IR Gen 3 is a valuable addition to any weapon system for anyone who demands superior illumination and performance.
\n

\n
\nIt is an IWB holster that is as comfortable as it is rugged. The reinforced injection-molded polymer construction makes it extremely lightweight and low profile. The slim, minimal sweat guard provides an effective barrier between your body and the firearm, allowing you to holster and unholster when needed rapidly. The GLC/SWC comes with a C clip that is fully tuckable and less visible along the beltline, which makes for deep concealment.

\nINFORCE has launched the latest weapon mounted light, the WMLX White Gen 3, which is a significant upgrade over its predecessor. This version is brighter and more powerful than ever before, boasting over twice the beam intensity on the same battery, without compromising on battery life, which remains at a solid 2 hours. With a beam intensity of 25,000 candelas on a 1,100 lumen bulb, the WMLX White Gen 3 emits an extremely bright light that is more than five times the amount needed to blind someone in broad daylight. With a range of 1,036.75 feet (316m), this weapon light is perfect for close quarter engagements when mounted to a shotgun or pistol-caliber carbine, or mid-range shooting when clipped onto a rifle.<img src=""https://opl.0ps.us/assets-1e39b27835f/base/opweb/base/desktop/img/pixels/description-product-pixel.gif"" alt=""image"" width=""1"" height=""1"" />
\n
\nThe ergonomic nonslip button of the WMLX White Gen 3 is contoured to the shape of the human thumb, rendering tape switches of older designs obsolete. The button allows for intuitive activation and deactivation of the light, while a flip safety ensures that it cannot be accidentally turned on. INFORCE has constructed the WMLX White Gen 3 with glass reinforced nylon, making it impervious to dirt, sand, and other solid debris. The light is also waterproof up to 66 feet/20 meters. This lightweight and durable rifle light is perfect for hunters and riflemen and showcases INFORCE's dedication to quality, reliability, and customer satisfaction.

\n
\nProgressive Recoil Spring differs from the common spring by the fact that the distance between coils keeps reducing starting from the middle of the spring till the last coil.
\n
\nWhile getting pressure the spring starts functioning <strong>in two phases</strong>:
\n<strong>• 1st:</strong> The first half of the spring with identical distance between coils starts compressing from the beginning.
\n<strong>• 2nd:</strong> After the first half has been fully shrunk the second half with reduced coil distance starts its compressing as well.
\n
\nEach coil increases the spring compression. Full compression provides maximum resistance and reduces recoil impulse.
\n
\nEvery Eemann Tech Recoil spring has its own unique colour that allows visual identification of the power value throughout its whole service life period.
\n
\nAll springs are painted with polymer heat treated paint which remains flexible throughout the whole period of service. The paint does not ruin or dye handgun from inside.

It features 2 mirrored tapered locking nuts that provide evenly distributed clamping pressure across a custom engineered barrel nut with use of a turnbuckle screw.

25512,simple,OOM-BASE,"ARISAKA Offset Optic Mount",1,0,visible,,"The Patented Arisaka Offset Optic Mount is a modular mounting solution that allows the user to select a 35 or 45 degree offset position for their red dot sight without additional components. The 35 degree position brings the red dot sight up closer to slimmer, smaller scopes, while the 45 degree position provides additional clearance around wider turrets.
\n
\nThe mount is set to 35 or 45 degrees by reversing the stem between the optic plate and base during assembly. The mount's unique geometry correctly aligns the optic vertically over the bore and maintains a consistent height at both 35 and 45 degrees.
\n
\nTwo heights of plates are offered; standard (1.5"" to 1.8"") and tall (1.9"" to 2.2""). The base and optic plates can be reversed, making the mount <strong>fully ambidextrous</strong>. It is recommended that you choose the plate height that corresponds to your primary optic height. For example, if your scope is mounted in a 1.54” height mount, you’d choose the regular height plate for your offset red dot. This ensures a consistent cheek weld and seamless transition between your primary optic and offset red dot.",,,taxable,,1,,,0,0,1,,,,1,,,2700000,"Mounting, Mounts & Sights Rifle",,,"https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/136.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/137.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/136.png, https://swarnatactical.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1381-1.png",,,,,,,,,0,,,,,,,,,,,327,60,,,,,,,,,0,,,,,"2025-01-13 08:58:07",,0,,no,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

\n
\nMake Picatinny Great Again with the Patent Pending Arisaka Rail Slider. It transforms the Picatinny rail on your rifle into a multi-position sliding mount with a push button recoil lug. A unique detented knob is used to set sliding tension, accounts for out-of-spec rails, allows the mount to be removed or installed without having to slide it off the end of the rail, and can be quickly and easily tightened down for maximum precision.
\n
\nThe Rail Slider features the ARMS 17S pattern for compatibility with popular bipods like the Atlas PSR, Atlas CAL, MDT Cyke, and Magpul 17S Bipod. It can also be used with Harris swivel bipods by adding our <a href=""https://arisakadefense.com/17-s-harris-bipod-adapter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">17-S Harris Bipod Adapter</a>.
\n
\nAdditionally, we offer several ball head adapters so that the Rail Slider can be used on top of a tripod. In this arrangement the user can quickly drop a Picatinny railed rifle on top, or use our <a href=""https://arisakadefense.com/rail-slider-lrf/spotter-adapter/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">LRF/Spotter Adapter</a> to mount spotting scopes, laser range finders, or any other compatible gear.
\n
\nWeight: 2.2 oz.
\n
\nThe Rail Slider is CNC machined from stainless steel and MIL-A-8625 Type III hard coat anodized 6061-T651 aluminum. Includes two 10-32 socket cap screws. Requires a 5/32 Allen wrench for installation (not included). Recommended torque: 30 inch lbs.

\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F59069AC"">The Magpul M-LOK AFG (Angled Fore Grip) is the result of research and refinements done to the original AFG and AFG-2. By integrating the direct-attach M-LOK mounting system with minimalist construction, we were able to produce a high strength grip that only weighs 1.2 ounces, including hardware. </span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F59069BB"">Allowing for a wider range of mounting location options, the M-LOK AFG is ¾"" shorter than the AFG-2, while maintaining a similar gripping surface area. Even though the M-LOK AFG is more compact than its predecessors, it takes into account natural body mechanics to provide a comfortable and stable user interface that reduces fatigue and allows for more precise weapon control. By positioning the shooter's hand high on the centerline of the bore, unlike conventional vertical fore grips, the M-LOK AFG helps mitigate recoil and control the weapon to facilitate faster, more accurate follow-up shots.</span>
\n
\n<span data-pb-style=""60AF4F59069CA"">All hardware necessary for attachment directly to M-LOK Slots on either aluminum or polymer hand guards and forends is included.</span>
